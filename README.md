## About this application

This is a Fullstack application developed in Next.js, that allows you to create a simple prompt sharing. I used NextAuth, where each user will log-in through their google account. Also in the development of this application, operations to create a prompt card, edit or delete are used. I used MongoDb database, where is stored users and the prompts.



## Getting Started

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_URL_INTERNAL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
GOOGLE_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
MONGODB_URI=
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials. You can obtain these credentials by signing up on these corresponding websites from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?rapt=AEjHL4MBaLLneW6OfAHf_zgms1eWZFw1wdy0_KIC4uh1nEqh2m4ojOvrXNlzJ4h7CZTkpiWgcsoHbUvS-FMdCP7WIkaVlPAeU7cnVR6Y0wJHeLMOtU6KAzA&project=promptopia-385410), [Cryptpool](https://www.cryptool.org/en/cto/openssl) (for random Auth Secret), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). 

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
